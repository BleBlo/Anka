KEY CLAIMS (with supporting evidence)
================================================================================

CLAIM 1: "LLMs can learn novel DSLs from prompts alone"
  Evidence: 99.9% parse success with zero training data
  The model had never seen Anka syntax before, yet generated
  valid Anka code in 99.9% of attempts.

CLAIM 2: "Constrained syntax reduces multi-step pipeline errors"
  Evidence: 40% accuracy advantage on multi-step tasks (100% vs 60%)
  Python's flexibility allows errors that Anka's explicit syntax prevents:
  - Variable shadowing: Anka requires explicit INTO clauses
  - Operation order: Anka enforces step-by-step declarations
  - State management: Each Anka step produces named output

CLAIM 3: "Anka outperforms Python overall despite Python training advantage"
  Evidence: 95.8% vs 91.2% (+4.6 percentage points)
  The LLM has billions of Python examples in training, yet
  performs better on a language learned from a single prompt.

CLAIM 4: "Advantage increases with task complexity"
  Evidence:
  - Simple tasks (1-2 ops): ~0% advantage
  - Medium tasks (3-4 ops): +5% advantage
  - Complex tasks (5+ ops): +40% advantage
  Anka's explicit structure becomes more valuable as complexity increases.

IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

1. DSL DESIGN FOR LLMs:
   Languages can be designed specifically for LLM generation.
   Constraints that might annoy humans (verbose keywords, explicit types)
   actually help LLMs generate correct code.

2. PROMPT-BASED LANGUAGE LEARNING:
   In-context learning is sufficient to teach complex DSLs.
   No fine-tuning or additional training required.

3. RELIABLE CODE GENERATION:
   For critical applications, using a constrained DSL may be
   more reliable than using general-purpose languages.
